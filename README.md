Swipefright is a site I built as a learning project.  The site itself is for people to post their funny/creepy online dating conversations.

For me, this site was really just an excuse to learn a variety of technologies.  These include:

* Functional Programming
* Clojurescript
* Elixir
* Docker
* RabbitMQ
* React/Reagent
* SASS
etc

As well as techniques such as:

* Immutable Database Updates
* Canary Blue/Green Deployment
* Varios Scalability Concerns (pretend concerns, in this case :))

To that end, the project was a success!  Need to market it, though, if I want anyone to ever actually see it!
